Custom fonts management and self-host Google Fonts with seamless WordPress page builders integration

== Description ==

Yabe Webfont helps you use custom fonts on WordPress and easily self-host the Google Fonts.

Leverage Browser Cache, reduce DNS lookups/requests, reduce Cumulative Layout Shift and make your Google Fonts 100% GDPR compliant.

### GDPR Compliant

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union.
When using a Google Font on your website, you are required to get to get the consent from visitors before displaying the font.
You can avoid this by self-hosting the font on your website and not need to show your website visitors the GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner.

### Performance

Serving the font file from your own server will improve the website performance by reducing DNS lookups/requests and leverage Browser Cache.
It will also reduce the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and improve the Core Web Vitals.

### User friendly

The plugin is designed to be user friendly and easy to use. It just require a few clicks!

- **Custom Fonts** ‚Äî Upload your custom fonts and use them on your WordPress website.
- **Google Fonts Import** ‚Äî Type on the search box to find the Google Fonts you want to self-host, then click the import button.
- **Adobe Fonts** ‚Äî Add the project/kit ID to use the Adobe Fonts on your WordPress website.

### Seamless integration with page builders

Yabe Webfont is designed to be seamlessly integrated with the most popular page builders.
