Self-hosting Google Fonts and register to Bricks' Custom Font seamlessly.

== Description ==

Yabe Webfont help you to self-hosting the Google Fonts and register the font to the [Bricks](https://bricksbuilder.io)' Custom Font with ease.

Leverage Browser Cache, reduce DNS lookups/requests, reduce Cumulative Layout Shift and make your Google Fonts 100% GDPR compliant.

= GDPR Compliant =
The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union.
When using a Google Font on your website, you are required to get to get the consent from visitors before displaying the font.
You can avoid this by self-hosting the font on your website and not need to show your website visitors the GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner.

= Performance =
Serving the font file from your own server will improve the website performance by reducing DNS lookups/requests and leverage Browser Cache.
It will also reduce the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and improve the Core Web Vitals.

* All Google Fonts is available — Type on the search box to find the Google Fonts you want to self-host.
* Download only what you need — Select the font subsets, font weights and the file format.
* No hassle — Just click the "Import" button, and the font will be downloaded and registered to the Bricks' Custom Font.
